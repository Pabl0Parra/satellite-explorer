        <p>
          Space debris represents defunct artificial objects in space which no longer serve a useful function. The
          debris is composed of old satellites, abandoned launch vehicle stages, mission-related debris, and
          fragmentation debris.

          It's not possible to track all the debris objects. According to{' '}

        spacecraft when travelling at these speeds.

        <h3>Collisions in space</h3>
        <p>
          Satellite operators frequently maneuver their satellites to avoid potential collisions with debris fragments.
          There have been several prominent space collisions, whose fragments are displayed on the map (their positions
          are predicted as of March 28th, 2022). The collision in 2009 was accidental and the others were triggered on

              the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) to take shelter in their escape capsules for the first
              few passes of the debris cloud, and increased the future risk of a debris collision with the ISS or other
              satellites.

        <h3>Who cleans up outer space?</h3>
        <p>
          Space debris poses a real challenge in the future, especially with the rise of megaconstellations. Space
          organizations and companies compete for innovative solutions to clean up debris and make outer space safer.
          Below are some examples of projects in development that use various technologies to clean up space:

          The European Space Agency is testing a new laser ranging station in Tenerife, Spain. Using powerful lasers
          they can rapidly determine the location, velocity and orbit of previously invisible defunct objects. They can
          also gently nudge debris objects into new orbit to avoid collision. Read more about this technology on the{' '}

          The idea of the program is to launch two spacecrafts - a servicer satellite and a client satellite - to track
          down and dock dead satellites and remove them from the orbit. Astroscale, the Japanese-based company behind
          the mission successfully carried tests in 2021 where they did multiple dockings and releasing of satellite
          targets. In 2022 they experienced difficulties with the test program. Read more about{' '}

          is a startup that plans to launch a network of satellites that would capture pieces of debris while in orbit.
          Once they have captured a set amount of debris they are programmed to de-orbit and burn up in the atmosphere.
          The first three test satellites will be launched later in 2022.
