      <h1>Satellite Explorer</h1>
      <h2>Why do we need satellites?</h2>
      <div>
        Did you ever get your location on your phone or set the navigation system in the car to guide you to a
        destination? Then you've definitely used satellites.
        <p>
          Localization via satellite navigation systems is widely used in almost all industries: transportation,
          emergency response, farming, banking, military, science. These satellites determine the location, velocity,
          and current time of small electronic devices (like the ones in our smart phones).
        </p>
        <p>
          Communications satellites are used for television, radio, and internet broadcasting. This sector increased
          lately with more and more companies launching satellites to provide internet everywhere on the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earth Observation satellites provide information about earth resources, weather, climate, and environmental
          monitoring. Imaging satellites produce high-resolution data of almost the entire landmass on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Space Observation also benefits from satellite data: satellite telescopes have been critical to understanding
          phenomena like pulsars and black holes as well as measuring the age of the universe.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Where are satellite orbits?</h2>
      <div>
        Although the space beyond Earth's atmosphere is vast, man-made satellites are typically located in one of the
        three popular orbital regimes: low earth orbit, medium earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit.
      </div>

      <h2>Who owns all the satellites?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          There are thousands of active satellites out there and 75 different countries have at least one satellite
          orbiting Earth. United States, China, and United Kingdom top the list of countries with hundreds of
          operational satellites.
        </p>
        <p>
          When looking at individual satellite operators we can see that private companies own most of the active
          satellites. SpaceX is the big winner, with 1,735 satellites as of January 2022.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>What is space debris?</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Space debris represents defunct artificial objects in space which no longer serve a useful function. The
          debris is composed of old satellites, abandoned launch vehicle stages, mission-related debris, and
          fragmentation debris.
        </p>
        <h3>How much space debris is out there?</h3>
        <p>
          It's not possible to track all the debris objects. According to{' '}
          <a href="https://www.esa.int/Safety_Security/Space_Debris/Space_debris_by_the_numbers" target="_blank">
            a European Space Agency article </a
          >{' '} there are around:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>36,500</span> pieces of debris <br />
          larger than 10 cm/4 inches
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>1,000,000</span> pieces of debris <br />
          larger than 1 cm/0.4 inches
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>130 million</span> pieces of debris <br />
          about 1 mm/0.04 inches and larger
        </p>
        These objects travel at speeds up to 28,160 kph/17,500 mph so even if they are very small they can damage a
        spacecraft when travelling at these speeds.
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Collisions in space</h3>
        <p>
          Satellite operators frequently maneuver their satellites to avoid potential collisions with debris fragments.
          There have been several prominent space collisions, whose fragments are displayed on the map (their positions
          are predicted as of March 28th, 2022). The collision in 2009 was accidental and the others were triggered on
          purpose by{' '}

              <span> Cosmos 1408</span> satellite was destroyed in a Russian anti-satellite weapon test on November 15,
              2021, resulting in space debris in orbits between 300 km/190 mi and 1,100 km/680 mi above the Earth. The
              threat of potential collision with debris caused the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) to take
              shelter in their escape capsules for the first few passes of the debris cloud, and increased the future
              risk of a debris collision with the ISS or other satellites.

        <h3>Who cleans up outer space?</h3>
        <p>
          Space debris poses a real challenge in the future, especially with the rise of megaconstellations. Space
          organizations and companies compete for innovative solutions to clean up debris and make outer space safer.
          Below are some examples of projects in development that use various technologies to clean up space:
        </p>
        <h4>Iza√±a-1 laser ranging station</h4>
        <p>
          The European Space Agency is testing a new laser ranging station in Tenerife, Spain. Using powerful lasers
          they can rapidly determine the location, velocity and orbit of previously invisible defunct objects. They can
          also gently nudge debris objects into new orbit to avoid collision. Read more about this technology on the{'

        <h4>Mission ClearSpace-1</h4>
        {' '}
        <p>
          The mission, planned for 2025, will use a four-armed robot to capture a Vega Secondary Payload Adapter, left
          behind by ESA's Vega launcher in 2013. This is a partnership between the{' '}

          , a Swiss based start-up.
        </p>
        <h4>ELSA spacecraft retrieval service</h4>
        <p>
          The idea of the program is to launch two spacecrafts - a servicer satellite and a client satellite - to track
          down and dock dead satellites and remove them from the orbit. Astroscale, the Japanese-based company behind
          the mission successfully carried tests in 2021 where they did multiple dockings and releasing of satellite
          targets. In 2022 they experienced difficulties with the test program. Read more about{' '}
          <a href="https://astroscale.com/missions/elsa-d/" target="_blank"> the mission on their website </a>
          .
        </p>
        <h4>E-Space</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.e-space.com/news" target="_blank"> E-Space </a>{' '} is a startup that plans to launch a
          network of satellites that would capture pieces of debris while in orbit. Once they have captured a set amount
          of debris they are programmed to de-orbit and burn up in the atmosphere. The first three test satellites will
          be launched later in 2022.
