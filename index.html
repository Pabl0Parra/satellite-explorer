            "text": "Localization via satellite navigation systems is widely used in almost all industries: transportation, emergency response, farming, banking, military, science. These satellites determine the location, velocity, and current time of small electronic devices (like the ones in our smart phones).

            Communications satellites are used for television, radio, and internet broadcasting. This sector increased lately with more and more companies launching satellites to provide internet everywhere on the globe.

            Earth Observation satellites provide information about earth resources, weather, climate, and environmental monitoring. Imaging satellites produce high-resolution data of almost the entire landmass on earth.

            Space Observation also benefits from satellite data: satellite telescopes have been critical to understanding phenomena like pulsars and black holes as well as measuring the age of the universe. "

            "text": "There are thousands of active satellites out there and 75 different countries have at least one satellite orbiting Earth. United States, China, and United Kingdom top the list of countries with hundreds of operational satellites.

            When looking at individual satellite operators we can see that private companies own most of the active satellites. SpaceX is the big winner, with 1,735 satellites as of January 2022."

According to a European Space Agency article there are around 36,500 pieces of debris larger than 10 cm/4 inches; 1,000,000 pieces of debris larger than 1 cm/0.4 inches; 130 million pieces of debris about 1 mm/0.04 inches and larger.

            These objects travel at speeds up to 28,160 kph/17,500 mph so even if they are very small they can damage a spacecraft when travelling at these speeds."
